Hello there.

My name is Sune Quist, and I am currently 20 years old (yes I know old haha). Anyway, I mainly program in JavaScript, but I love learning new languages often and have a ton of files that I never uploaded to Github. Hence why you barely see any contributions from my Github, I also worked using GitLab.

I often upload my progress on Twitter though, and you can feel free to go ahead and check that out as well. I have also thought about writing some books on different topics.
