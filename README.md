Hmm, I love gaining new knowledge to pass on to others and form assumptions based on knowledge from those different subjects.

Volunteer at *The Danish Youth Association of Science*<br/>
Currently studying some Networking and ways to approach data-intensive applications.<br/>
**Well what I like to do?** Design and the study of psychology, I like John (Dewey) even though his books are a bit difficult to read at times, and I forget 95% of his teachings.<br/><br/>
95% of my projects will never be on Github, and the ones you see are random ones where I remembered to upload them to Github, and if they are just complete uploads with few renditions, then they have probably been stashed away, and I randomly remembered to add them here.
