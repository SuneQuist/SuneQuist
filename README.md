### The developer learning curve is superficial.

Hi there, my name Sune Quist and I'm currently 19 years old (yeah, I know old right). Well, anyway, I love to learn and explore different areas of programming and design. In my free time, I... study?? I study around 90-110+ hours a week been doing so for around 1-2 years now (and no I'm not tired yet, ...yet). Well, I'll stop my monologing here and tell you what I do now.

I mainly program in Javascript and use React as my main framework. I love to do different weird challenges that I set myself, and I hate doing portfolio work either that or their "school" related projects.
